Airline billing solution

IATA
------------
The International Air Transport Association is a trade organization made up of the world's airlines and has influence over the commercial aspects of flight. For flight tracking purposes, the two most important pieces of information are IATA airline and airport codes, which are two and three letters long

Flight aggregators. 
-------------------
Aggregators are technology companies that source NDC, GDS, and LCC content from different airlines and communicate it to travel agencies via one normalized API. Read about leading flight aggregators in our previous article on NDC in air travel.

--------
GDS platforms are centralized repositories of travel services from multiple suppliers, simplifying the booking process for travel agents and online travel agencies. GDS is known for its extensive inventory, reliability, and global reach. It's the go-to choice for complex itineraries and has been the backbone of the travel industry for decades.

NDC - https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gds-vs-ndc-battle-travel-distribution-hitesh-ramoliya
-------
NDC, introduced by IATA, is a game-changer in travel distribution. Unlike GDS, NDC enables airlines to directly distribute their products to various sellers. This allows airlines to offer personalized pricing, dynamic fare adjustments, and rich content. NDC aims to provide travelers with a more tailored and responsive booking experience.
